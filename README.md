# PawCare-Connect
PawCare-Connect is a web-based platform designed to support stray animals by providing tools for user interaction, reporting, and awareness. It acts as a bridge between citizens, animal welfare NGOs, and veterinarians by simplifying the way help is requested and delivered. 

## Problem it Solves
Many stray animals suffer from lack of timely aid due to poor communication between the public and animal welfare organizations. People often don’t know how to help or where to report an animal in need. PawCare-Connect solves this by offering a centralized system for assistance and reporting.
